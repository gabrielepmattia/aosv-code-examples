/*
 * chardev.c: Creates a read-only char device that says how many times you've
 * read from the dev file.
 *
 * You can have some fun with this by removing the module_get/put calls,
 * allowing the module to be removed while the file is still open.
 *
 * Compile with `make`. Load with `sudo insmod chardev.ko`. Check `dmesg | tail`
 * output to see the assigned device number and command to create a device file.
 *
 * From TLDP.org's LKMPG book.
